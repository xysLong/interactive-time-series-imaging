# Interactive Time Series Imaging

This is a simple Flask web application that allows users to draw curves using their mouse on a canvas. The application then generates 2D images based on the Markov Transition Field or Gramian Angular Field of the drawn curve.

Created as an illustrative element within the context of my Master's thesis.
